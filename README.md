Fork of ClyphX by stray411

ClyphX is a great RemoteScript for Ableton Live written by stray411 of Beatwise Network.
It extend heavily the usability and the power of Live.

With stray411 own words: 

ClyphX is a MIDI Remote Script for Live 8.2.2 or later that provides an extensive list of Actions related to controlling different aspects of Live. These Actions can be accessed via X-Triggers (Session View Clips, Arrange View Locators or MIDI Controls). Each X-Trigger can trigger a single Action or a list of Actions.

Here some other informations about it: http://beatwise.proboards.com/board/5
In these Repository I will put changes to the original ClyphX for my personal (and maybe yours!) usage.
